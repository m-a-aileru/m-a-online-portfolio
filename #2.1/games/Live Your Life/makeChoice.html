		<h2>Make a Choice</h2>
		
		<p>So, you've been inside for at least 2 days now and forgotten what the sky looks like.
		   Do you want to go outside and let the light blind you (temporarily) before you breathe some
		   much needed fresh air in your lungs or are you spending (yet) another day inside for some more
		   warmth and comfort (and cowardice...joking!)?</p>
